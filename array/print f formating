To use the Java String printf method to format output text, follow these rules:



Use %s as the printf String specifier in the text string being formatted.
Use %S as the printf String specifier to output upper-case text.
Precede the letter s with a number to specify field width.
Put a negative sign after the % to left-justify the text.
Add %n any time you wish to include a line break.


The %d specifier is used for integer types,


 while %f is only used with a Java float or double.
